# Politiscales

An online political test that represents you politically along 8 ideological axes.

You can see it in action on [politiscales.gouvernathor.fr](https://politiscales.gouvernathor.fr).

This is a remake, using the Angular framework, of the original Politiscales tool, which ran on `politiscales.net` and was taken offline between the 21st and the 28th of August 2020. That original Politiscales was itself was a fork of the [8values test](http://8values.github.io/), licensed under Expat/MIT license.
